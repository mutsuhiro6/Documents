# 1. From Parallel to Distributed

## Shared Memory Data-Parallelism

```scala
val res = jar.map(jellyBean => doSomething(jellyBean))
```

* Split the data .
* Workers / threads independently operate on the shards in paralell.
* Combine when done (if necessary).

## Distributed Data-Parallelism

```scala
val res = jar.map(jellyBean => doSomething(jellyBean))
```

- Split the data *over several nodes*.
- *Nodes* independently operate on the data shards in parallel.
- Combine when done (if necessary).

## Distribution

### 2 important issues for distributed computing

- *Partial failure:* crash failures of a subset of the machines involved in a distributed computation.
- *Latency:* certain operations have a much higher latency than other operations due to network communication.
